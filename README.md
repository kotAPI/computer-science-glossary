embarassingly parallel - when tasks can be performed without coordination overhead - for example finding a specific word from all the books in a library, scheduling buses on the other hand isn't, as coordination between buses time schedule is important

Pipelining is a form of parallelism where tasks are solved faster by having multiple tasks simultaneously at various levels of completion.
