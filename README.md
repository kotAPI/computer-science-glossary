embarassingly parallel - when tasks can be performed without coordination overhead - for example finding a specific word from all the books in a library, scheduling buses on the other hand isn't, as coordination between buses time schedule is important

Pipelining is a form of parallelism where tasks are solved faster by having multiple tasks simultaneously at various levels of completion.


Latency is the time it takes for a process to go from start to finish

throughput is the rate at which a system can finish processes.

Caching is a general problem-solving approach that provides a much more flexible way of dealing with certain resource tradeoffs.


Interface is an abstraction that manages complexity by defining how to interact with a process while hiding how the process actually gets done.


Eulerian path - A path through a graph that visits every edge once is called an Eulerian path. Eulerian paths are named after Leonhard Euler, who is credited with first solving the puzzle of the seven bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg. if a graph has more than two vertices with an odd number of connected edges, there's no way a Eulerian path can exist.
